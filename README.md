#### Resources on Computer Graphics and OpenGL:

##### The red book of OpenGL
* [The red book of OpenGL](http://www.opengl-redbook.com/). Here is the [online version](https://www.glprogramming.com/red/) of this book. Is also available [here](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/fussell/courses/cs354/handouts/Addison.Wesley.OpenGL.Programming.Guide.8th.Edition.Mar.2013.ISBN.0321773039.pdf).
    - Another, very much similar to above mentioned book with a comprehensive tutorial and reference on OpenGL, shaders and mathematical foundation for the same - [OpenGL Superbible](http://www.openglsuperbible.com/).

##### A beautiful book open sourced - for physically based rendering:
* Photorealistic computer graphics is ubiquitous today, with applications that include entertainment—notably, movies and video games; product design; and architecture. Donald Knuth wrote “This book has deservedly won an Academy Award. I believe it should also be nominated for a Pulitzer Prize.” Read about the book [Physically Based Rendering](http://www.pbr-book.org/), which will link you to the contents of the book to [Physically Based Rendering:Contents](http://www.pbr-book.org/3ed-2018/contents.html).
And more fun - here is the [source code used by the book](https://github.com/mmp/pbrt-v3).

##### Another great piece of literature on computer graphics:
* [Real Time Rendering](http://www.realtimerendering.com/) is a legend which focuses on modern techniques used to generate synthetic three-dimensional images in a fraction of a second. With the advent of programmable shaders, a wide variety of new algorithms have arisen and evolved over the past few years. This edition discusses current, practical rendering methods used in games and other applications. It also presents a solid theoretical framework and relevant mathematics for the field of interactive computer graphics, all in an approachable style.
    - They also list a helluva lot of [graphics books resources](http://www.realtimerendering.com/books.html) except their own book on their website.
    - And here is their [blog](http://www.realtimerendering.com/blog/).

------------------------------------------------

#### Getting started on developing graphical application with **Raylib** (has very good C++ bindings) as base library:
* [**Raylib**](https://www.raylib.com/) is a simple and easy-to-use library to enjoy game programming.
    - raylib is a programming library to enjoy games programming; no fancy interface, no visual helpers, no auto-debugging... just coding in the most pure spartan-programmers way. **It's specially well suited for prototyping and tooling graphical applications, game engines, games etc.**
    - It is a very modular library, defined by a small number of specific and self-contained modules. Every module is organized by its main functionality (avoiding hundreds of modules depending on other modules, like other C libraries).
        - See about its [architecture here](https://github.com/raysan5/raylib/wiki/raylib-architecture).
        - Repeating... **Its NOT a game engine, BUT, you can use it as a base library to prototyping and tooling graphical applications/tools or game engine or games on top of it.**
        - It is writtent in C but has a very nice [C++ bindings](https://github.com/robloach/raylib-cpp). So you can start development in C++.
    - See its [examples](https://www.raylib.com/examples.html). Some interesting examples:
        - [Raylib Shader programming and loading shader example - A CUBE OF DANCING CUBES!](https://www.raylib.com/examples/web/shaders/loader.html?name=shaders_rlgl_mesh_instanced).
        - [Raylib creative coding inspiration 1 - waving cubes](https://www.raylib.com/examples/web/models/loader.html?name=models_waving_cubes).
        - [Raylib creative coding inspiration 2 - heightmap](https://www.raylib.com/examples/web/models/loader.html?name=models_heightmap).
        - [Raylib creative coding inspiration 3 - particle effects](https://www.raylib.com/examples/web/textures/loader.html?name=textures_particles_blending).
    - [Raylib wiki](https://github.com/raysan5/raylib/wiki). For example tutorial on getting started on linux:
        - [Working with Raylib on Linux](https://github.com/raysan5/raylib/wiki/Working-on-GNU-Linux).
        - [VSCode IDE configuration](https://github.com/raysan5/raylib/wiki/Using-raylib-in-VSCode).
    - You could also later integrate it with libraries like [OpenCV for image processing and computer vision](https://opencv.org/) or [Dlib](http://dlib.net/) or any other libraries for any functionalities you would require in future.

        - Here is an [example project - Cubes](http://graphicscodex.com/projects/cubes/index.html).
    2. To see in which order the projects should be completed see these [dependencies description](http://graphicscodex.com/projects/projects/#dependencies). Looks like there are no strict dependencies.
    
-----------------------------------------------------

#### Getting Started with OpenGL application development on Linux:

1. **Setup OpenGL environment on Linux**:
    - Follow the instructions documented here for [setting up OpenGL environment on Linux](https://github.com/roshanpoudyal/Linux/wiki/Setting-up-OpenGL-environment-on-Linux).

2. **Setup an OpenGL application Software Development Kit (SDK) on Linux**:
    - Follow the [instruction documented here](includes/How_To_Include_Dependencies.md) to compile, build and use the libraries mentioned in learnopengl.com to develop OpenGL application SDK framework in Linux.

3. How to build this OpenGL application :
* It should be already noted that we use `cmake` and `make` to compile and build our application. Following easy to follow steps guide the same:
    1. Create a `build` folder in root directory of our project : `mkdir build`
    2. Enter this `build` folder : `cd build`
    3. Run `cmake` pointing the correct CMakeLists.txt file in root directory of our project to compile it : `cmake ..`
    4. Run `make` to build our project : `make`
    5. You will get the executables built in this `build` folder.

#### **Note that** 
1. You can also use [Glitter](https://github.com/Polytonic/Glitter) to get started with OpenGL, it is is a dead simple boilerplate for OpenGL, intended as a starting point for the tutorials on learnopengl.com and open.gl. See its [sample usage](https://github.com/Polytonic/Glitter/tree/master/Samples) on how to use Glitter.
2. Alternatively, you could use [GFX](https://github.com/gboisse/gfx) - a minimalist and easy to use graphics API.
    
------------------------------------------------

#### More of my related and future possible projects:
1. Learn building rendering engine : [related project](https://github.com/roshanpoudyal/3D_interactive_graphics_rendering_engine)

#### Future direction:
1. Implement [catlikecoding tutorials](https://catlikecoding.com/unity/tutorials/) by using only shaders in the basic OpenGL framework you built here. **If it is possible to do [this](http://www.iquilezles.org/www/articles/sdfmodeling/sdfmodeling.htm) just using shaders, why don't you give it a try as well.**
    1. Basically use the environment created in this project to work on [this project](https://github.com/roshanpoudyal/Catlikecoding-tutorials-with-Cpp). 
1. Do all of this OpenGL project to [display graphics in Android (mobile) platform using Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/training/graphics/opengl/).
